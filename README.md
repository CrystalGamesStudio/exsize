 # ExSize - Rewards and Tasks System 🎮🎯🎉

ExSize is a comprehensive rewards system that motivates regular activities through tasks, coins, VIP points and events. In most seasons, events will be organized that include collaborations with various companies, cartoons and other partners. In seasons without collaborations, no new products will appear - instead, items from previous events will be available. 🎭🎁✨

## 🎟️ Size Pass

is a special pass that unlocks most of the additional features of ExSize. Achievements are available only to its holders. It can also be obtained for free after a year of regular completion of tasks. The pass is available in two variants: standard and Ultra, which offers additional benefits. Size Pass lasts two months, just like the store and app seasons.

## 💰 Coins

can be earned by completing tasks and missions. Parents have the option to set the amount of coins awarded for completed tasks. Event missions offer bigger rewards. Coins can be spent in the store on various items and decorations. Parents can add tasks in the dedicated app, and completing them rewards the user with coins and VIP points (for VIP package holders). Tasks vary in difficulty - the harder, the bigger the reward. Size Pass holders have no task limit.

## 🎨 For the coins earned

you can buy various extras in the store, such as avatar decorations, frames or upgrades. There are two store variants: General and Event. The event variant offers items available only for a limited time. All items have a limited number of available copies - the cheaper, the larger the number. Each change of a purchased item costs additional coins.

## 🏅 The achievements tab

is available only for Size Pass holders. There you can track your progress and complete subsequent goals, which are saved in the system. The inventory contains all purchased items. You can change the appearance of your avatar and customize its decorations. Each avatar change is associated with a small fee in coins.

## 📅 In the Missions tab

daily, weekly, and yearly tasks are available. Each mission awards coin rewards. It is possible to refresh an entire mission category for a certain amount of coins, allowing you to gain new challenges.
