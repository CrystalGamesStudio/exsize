ExSize - Rewards and Tasks System

ExSize is a comprehensive rewards system that motivates regular activities through tasks, coins, VIP points and events. In most seasons, events will be organized, including collaborations with various companies, cartoons and other partners. In seasons without collaborations, no new products will appear - instead, items from previous events will be available.

Size Pass is a special pass that unlocks most of the additional features of ExSize. Achievements are available only to its holders. It can also be obtained for free after a year of regular completion of tasks. The pass is available in two versions: standard and Ultra, which offers additional benefits. Size Pass lasts two months, just like the store and app seasons.

Coins can be earned by completing tasks and missions. Parents have the option to set the amount of coins awarded for completed tasks. Event missions offer bigger rewards. Coins can be spent in the store on various items and decorations. Parents can add tasks in a dedicated app, and completing them rewards the user with coins and VIP points (for VIP package holders). Tasks vary in difficulty - the more difficult, the greater the reward. Size Pass holders have no task limit.

You can buy various extras in the store for the coins you earn, such as avatar decorations, frames or upgrades. There are two store variants: General and Event. The event variant offers items available only for a limited time. All items have a limited number of available copies - the cheaper they are, the more they are available. Each change of a purchased item costs additional coins.

The achievements tab is available only for Size Pass holders. You can track your progress there and complete subsequent goals that are saved in the system. The inventory contains all purchased items. You can change the appearance of your avatar and customize its decorations. Each avatar change is associated with a small fee in coins.

The Missions tab contains daily, weekly and annual tasks. Each mission awards prizes in the form of coins. It is possible to refresh an entire mission category for a certain amount of coins, allowing you to gain new challenges.
